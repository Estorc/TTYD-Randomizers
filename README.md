This contains the Item Randomizers and Loading Zone Randomizer that I have made. The initial code for this project came from PistonMiner's work. https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools  

The codes are stored on the save files (gci files) listed on the releases page. You must use the proper file for your version of the game.  
G8ME = US, G8MJ = JP, G8MP = EU

To use them on console, you need to use a homebrew app to move the save file onto your memory card, and then use the provided gct files with your prefered homebrew app.

To use them on an emulator such as Dolphin, you need to either import the save file onto the virtual memory card used by the emulator, or move the file into the GCI folder (this is a Dolphin thing). You must then use either the provided Action Replay code or the provided Gecko code. The Gecko code is shorter, so that is the prefered code to use. The Action Replay code is provided mainly for people who happen to be using the old Action Replay discs, or for people who are having issues applying Gecko codes in Dolphin.
